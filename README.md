### Contribution Rules
- ðŸš« **No external libraries**: Only Python **built-in packages** are allowed.  
- âœ… Goal: Practice, experiment, and push the limits of what can be done with standard Python.  
- ðŸ’¡ Contributions: Add new features, improve existing ones, or suggest design changes â€” as long as they follow the built-in-only rule.  
- ðŸŽ¯ Purpose: Learning and experimenting together, not user acquisition or monetization.  

Contributions, issues, and discussions are welcome!
